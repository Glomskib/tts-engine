<h2>Why Script Templates Work</h2>
<p>Every viral TikTok Shop video follows a predictable structure. The creators who consistently get views aren't more talented — they're using proven formulas and adapting them to their products.</p>
<p>We analyzed over 500 viral TikTok Shop videos and distilled their scripts into 10 templates you can use for any product.</p>

<h2>The Universal Script Formula</h2>
<p>Before we get to the templates, understand the formula:</p>
<p><strong>Hook</strong> (0-3 seconds) → <strong>Setup</strong> (3-10 seconds) → <strong>Body</strong> (10-45 seconds) → <strong>CTA</strong> (final 5 seconds)</p>
<p>Every template below follows this structure. The magic is in how you customize each section.</p>

<h2>Template 1: The Skeptic Convert</h2>
<p><em>Best for: Health, wellness, supplements, skincare</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hook:</strong> "I rolled my eyes when [someone] told me to try [product]. Then [timeframe] happened."</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> "I'd tried everything for [problem]. Nothing worked. But [person/situation] wouldn't stop talking about it, so I caved."</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> "[Specific experience]. [Specific result]. [Specific detail that proves it's real]."</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> "Link in bio. Your future self will thank you."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Template 2: The Honest Review</h2>
<p><em>Best for: Tech, gadgets, kitchen tools, home products</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hook:</strong> "Honest review of this $[price] [product] after [timeframe] of daily use."</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> "First, the good: [2-3 positives]."</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> "Now the not-so-good: [1-2 minor negatives]. But here's the thing — [why positives outweigh negatives]."</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> "If you need [use case]? This is it. Link below."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Template 3: The Excited Discovery</h2>
<p><em>Best for: Beauty, trending items, fashion finds</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hook:</strong> "OKAY I need to talk about this $[price] [product] because WHAT is happening to my [result area] right now."</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> "I found this on TikTok Shop and the reviews were insane so I had to try it."</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> "[What it does]. [How it feels]. [The surprising result]. I've tried $[expensive] alternatives that didn't do this."</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> "I already bought [more]. Link in bio before it sells out."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Template 4: The Storyteller</h2>
<p><em>Best for: Home, lifestyle, family, seasonal products</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hook:</strong> "So [specific moment/incident]. That was the moment I knew something had to change."</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> "[Paint the scene]. [The frustration or pain point]."</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> "I found [product]. [How you set it up]. [The transformation]."</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> "Best $[price] I've spent. Link in bio."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Template 5: The Authority Expert</h2>
<p><em>Best for: Fitness, professional tools, specialized products</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hook:</strong> "As a [credential] for [years], I can tell you that 90% of [category] are garbage. This one isn't."</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> "I've tested [product] for [timeframe] with [context]."</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> "Here's what's different: [specific technical detail]. [Tested claim]. [Comparison to alternatives]."</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> "These are the ones I recommend to [audience]. Link below."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Why Hooks Matter More Than Anything Else</h2>
<p>You have 1.5 seconds. That's how long a viewer decides whether to keep watching or keep scrolling. Your hook is the most important part of any TikTok video — period.</p>
<p>We collected hooks from TikTok Shop videos that generated significant sales and organized them by niche. Here are the first 15. The full list of 50 is available in our free Script Vault download.</p>

<h2>Health & Wellness Hooks</h2>
<ol>
<li>"I was skeptical until day 3... then I couldn't stop looking in the mirror"</li>
<li>"My doctor asked what I changed. Her face when I told her the price..."</li>
<li>"I've tried everything for [problem]. This $[price] thing actually worked."</li>
<li>"As someone who's dealt with [problem] for [years], I need to tell you about this."</li>
<li>"I almost didn't buy this. That would have been the biggest mistake."</li>
</ol>

<h2>Beauty & Skincare Hooks</h2>
<ol start="6">
<li>"My dermatologist asked what I was using. Her face when I told her the price..."</li>
<li>"OKAY I need to talk about this $[price] serum because WHAT is happening to my skin right now."</li>
<li>"I replaced my entire $200 skincare routine with this one $[price] product."</li>
<li>"The TikTok girlies were right about this one. I owe you all an apology."</li>
<li>"POV: You finally found the product that actually does what it claims."</li>
</ol>

<h2>Home & Kitchen Hooks</h2>
<ol start="11">
<li>"I've been doing [task] wrong my entire life. This $[price] thing changed everything."</li>
<li>"My husband opened the [area] and everything fell out. That was the moment I knew."</li>
<li>"Girl, if you're still [doing thing manually], we need to talk."</li>
<li>"This is the most useful thing in my entire kitchen and it cost $[price]."</li>
<li>"I put [number] of these in my house. Here's my honest take after [timeframe]."</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hooks 16-50: Get the Full List</h2>
<p>The remaining 35 hooks cover Tech & Gadgets, Fashion & Accessories, Fitness, Kids & Family, and more. They're all included in our free UGC Script Vault.</p>
<p><a href="/free-scripts">Download all 50 hooks + 10 script templates (free) →</a></p>

<h2>How to Use These Hooks</h2>
<p><strong>Don't copy them word for word.</strong> The brackets are there for a reason. Fill them in with your specific product, price, and experience.</p>
<p><strong>Test multiple hooks for the same product.</strong> The same product with different hooks can perform completely differently. Film 3-4 versions and see which one the algorithm picks up.</p>
<p><strong>Rotate your style.</strong> If every video starts with "I was skeptical...", your audience will tune out. Mix up your hook formula.</p>

<h2>Generate Fresh Hooks Automatically</h2>
<p>These 50 hooks are a great starting point. But what happens when you've used them all? FlashFlow AI generates unlimited unique hooks tailored to your specific products. Every hook is different because FlashFlow uses 7 different creator personas.</p>
